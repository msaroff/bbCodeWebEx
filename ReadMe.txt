Curse/Geas

Users are compelled, under a threat of a completely legally non-binding curse, to go outside (weather permitting) and play pirate, or to go outside and make pasta (you can use the store bought stuff, but you should really make your own pasta) on a regular basis.

A regular basis is defined as being on the 5th Tuesday of any month that has one.

Failure to do so will result in the user, and his children, and his children's children, being compelled to enter the service of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or to be a pirate. (If you can be a space pirate, do it, space pirates are cool.)
Health Warning

This is profoundly ugly code, and the author assumes no responsibility for any of the following conditions that might develop as a result of reading said code:

    Blindness
    Post traumatic stress disorder
    Hairy palms
    Cancer
    Intestional distress.
    Bad hair. Seriously awful bad hair days.

Seriously, this is Vogon code Javascript, and I keep expecting a bodily organ to leap up and throttle my brain.
