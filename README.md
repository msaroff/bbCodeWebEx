A Webextensions Version of the Firefox extension bbCodeXtra, which is legacy (pre Quantum) extension.

This uses the context menu to automate the insertion of various codes (bbCode, HTML, XHTML, Vbulletin, Markdown) using a context menu.

Currently in pre alpha development.

## Firefox Versions
This extension supports Firefox 57 and above.

## Customization
Users will be able to create their own custom tags and symbols as well as turning on and off code menus.  (Not yet implemented)

Additionally, I am using the internatinal language codes he maintained for bbCodeXtra, as well as an almost direct copy of the code he used to generate lists.

## Curse/Geas
Users are compelled, under a threat of a completely legally non-binding curse, to go outside (weather permitting) and play pirate, or to go outside and make pasta (you can use the store bought stuff, but you should really make your own pasta) on a regular basis.

A regular basis is defined as being on the 5<sup>th</sup> Tuesday of any month that has one.

Failure to do so will result in the user, and his children, and his children's children, being compelled to enter the service of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, or to be a pirate.  (If you can be a space pirate, do it, space pirates are cool.)
